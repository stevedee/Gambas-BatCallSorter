To-Do
=====

general tidy up - remove refs related to original ImageViewer app. 

Add error handlers

GetNextFile - consider Cogiers suggestion of using a String[] index instead of file name; does this simplify/improve code

Auto-play (start playing) when AlsaPlayer loads.




Done
====

-----------Jun 5th 2018--------

btnProcessWavs: Don't delete original wav until the Normalised version has been successfully created.

FilePicker_Change(): Some controls need to be clear/hidden when there is no png file displayed (S_ not selected) so added
 some ugly If...then code to determine if anything is selected in FileView.
 
 SoX: Added 9kHz low pass filter for MP3 generation (not sure this makes any difference)

----------May 29th 2018---------
SoX:-
  added "-V4" to help debug problems when running in Gambas IDE.
  added high pass filter option to remove noise below cutoff frequency (either 1kHz, 10kHz or default 15kHz)
  added "gain -3" to stop hp-filter clipping

-----------May 25th 2018--------
SoX: added "trim" to remove the capacitor charge spike at the start of all recordings.
Increased headroom (--norm) from -2 to -3 to ensure no clipping.

Added option to save/delete original (unprocessed) recordings. Save in ../Originals

------------
Remove big image option

Return to file list (highlight/active) after closing Audacity or Alsaplayer

Added a Bat Echolocation guide (pdf file) via Help menu.
