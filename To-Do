To-Do
=====

general tidy up - remove refs related to original ImageViewer app. 

Add error handlers

GetNextFile - consider Cogiers suggestion of using a String[] index instead of file name; does this simplify/improve code

sort out control tab order

Auto-play (start playing) when AlsaPlayer loads.



Done
=====

SoX: added "trim" to remove the capacitor charge spike at the start of all recordings.
Increased headroom (--norm) from -2 to -3 to ensure no clipping.

Added option to save/delete original (unprocessed) recordings. Save in ../Originals

------------
Remove big image option

Return to file list (highlight/active) after closing Audacity or Alsaplayer

Added a Bat Echolocation guide (pdf file) via Help menu.
