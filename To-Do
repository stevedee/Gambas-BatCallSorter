To-Do
=====

general tidy up - remove refs related to original ImageViewer app. 

Add error handlers

GetNextFile - consider Cogiers suggestion of using a String[] index instead of file name; does this simplify/improve code

sort out control tab order

Auto-play (start playing) when AlsaPlayer loads.




Done
=====

Remove big image option

Return to file list (highlight/active) after closing Audacity or Alsaplayer
